InfusedEffects
=============

**_Ver. 1.2_**

**Added effects for armor!**

InfusedEffects is a plugin that lets you add potion effects to tools/weapons, projectiles, and food, and armor. When you eat food with effects applied, you will get those effects. Hitting a mob with a weapon that has an effect will give those effects to the mob. Same goes for projectiles, like arrows, snowballs, etc. Throw a projectile at a mob to give them the effects. This plugin is really great for adventure maps, mini-games, and regular PvP.


##Commands

**/addeffect \<effect type\> \<level\> \<duration\>**
Run this command when you are holding an item. The effect will get applied to the item.

**/deleffect \<effect type\|all\>**
This command deletes the specified effect from the item you are holding. If the parameter is "all", then all effects will get deleted.
